Collaborative Python!

Dojovial is a [Growler](https://github.com/pyGrowler/Growler) application 
providing web access to a sandboxed python environment allowing (authorized)
friends to connect to the server and run/share python code.

Inspired by the lack of collaboration available in iPython (with good reason)
mixed with the want to share/run code at python meetings (dojos).

The author pronounces is doe-joe-vee-all.
